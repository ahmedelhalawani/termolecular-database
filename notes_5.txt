1. Static system. Rate constant derived from variation of [Br₂], monitored by ab- sorption spectrophotometry. Pressure of added He ranged from 1 to 100 atm.
2.  Data derived using a diffusion flame method. Pressure range was approximately 7 to 20 torr.
3. Study of the pulse-radiolysis of H₂S. Experiments could be performed under static or flow conditions. Transient species (S₂ and SH) were monitored by kinetic spectroscopy, products were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Experimental S₂/SH profiles were compared to the results of numerical integration of proposed mechanism; rate constant obtained by fitting simulated profiles to experimental profiles.
4. Discharge-flow system. Rate constant derived from decay of N atoms, monitored by mass spectrometry.
5. Reaction studied by kinetic spectroscopy.
6. Rate data can be equally well represented by the expression k/cm^6mol^-2s^-1 = 4.8 x 10^25*T^-3.4
7. Rate data can be equally well represented by the expression k/cm^6mol^-2s^-1 = 2.1 x 10^25*T^-3.2.
8. Reaction studied using mass spectrometry.
9. [OH(²Σ⁺)] monitored by emission spectroscopy.
10. Rate constant derived by modeling flame inhibition data taken from the literature. 
11. Approximate value derived from graphical data in paper.
12. Data evaluation.
13. Laser photolyses at 266 nm with resonance fluorescence detection of 1. Rotational and vibrational state of I* unknown. Temperature assumed to be room temperature.
